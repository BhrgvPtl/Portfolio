        <h2>Business Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Renewals for mid-market customers were lagging, and marketing teams lacked visibility into
          which accounts were at the highest risk of churn. Without a reliable early warning system,
          customer success managers were triaging based on anecdotal signals and losing renewal
          conversations to competitors.

        <h2>Data Story</h2>
        <p>
          Exploratory analysis revealed that product adoption stalled roughly 60 days before renewal
          for accounts that eventually churned. Support ticket spikes and payment delays were the next
          leading signals. We crafted a narrative showing executives how combining these behaviors
          creates an actionable lead score. Weekly insights decks highlighted health trends across
          cohorts, enabling proactive outreach campaigns.

        <h2>Productionization</h2>
        <p>
          The scoring pipeline runs nightly using Airflow with CI/CD enforced through GitHub Actions.
          dbt tests ensure freshness and referential integrity before model inference executes. Model
          artifacts are tracked in MLflow, and the marketing automation triggers are gated behind
          feature flagging to support experimentation and rollback.

        <p>
          We are currently piloting reinforcement learning to optimize intervention timing and adding
          multi-touch attribution to better quantify campaign influence on retention.
