# Data Science & Engineering Portfolio

A single-page GitHub Pages site with narrative-driven case studies for data scientists and engineers.
The site highlights end-to-end project execution, professional storytelling, and clear calls-to-action
for prospective employers or clients.

## Features

- **Homepage** with an executive summary, curated project highlights, resume snapshot, and contact paths.
- **Dedicated project pages** for three end-to-end initiatives covering analytics, forecasting, and platform engineering.
- **Business-first storytelling** that connects data work to measurable outcomes, tooling, and production practices.
- **Responsive design** with dark-mode friendly styling suitable for desktop and mobile experiences.

## Local Development

No build step is required. Open `index.html` directly in your browser:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to preview the site.
